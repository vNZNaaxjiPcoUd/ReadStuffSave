    <p><strong>Planetary habitability</strong> is the measure of a <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planet" title="Planet">planet</a>&#39;s or a <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Natural_satellite" title="Natural satellite">natural satellite</a>&#39;s potential to <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Abiogenesis" title="Abiogenesis">develop</a> and maintain environments hospitable to <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Life" title="Life">life</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-NASA-20150407-1">[1]</a> Life may be <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Abiogenesis" title="Abiogenesis">generated directly</a> on a planet or satellite endogenously or be transferred to it from another body, through a hypothetical process known as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Panspermia" title="Panspermia">panspermia</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-NASA_strategy_2015-2">[2]</a> Environments do not need to contain life to be considered habitable nor are accepted <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Habitable_zone" title="Habitable zone">habitable zones</a> (HZ) the only areas in which life might arise.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Seager_2013-3">[3]</a></p>
    <p>As the existence of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Life_beyond_Earth" title="Life beyond Earth">life beyond Earth</a> is unknown, planetary habitability is largely an <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Extrapolation" title="Extrapolation">extrapolation</a> of conditions on Earth and the characteristics of the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Solar_System" title="Solar System">Solar System</a> which appear favorable to life&#39;s flourishing.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-4">[4]</a> Of particular interest are those factors that have sustained complex, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Multicellular" title="Multicellular">multicellular</a> organisms on Earth and not just simpler, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Unicellular" title="Unicellular">unicellular</a> creatures.

    <p>An absolute requirement for life is an <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Energy" title="Energy">energy</a> source, and the notion of planetary habitability implies that many other <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Geophysics" title="Geophysics">geophysical</a>, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Geochemical" title="Geochemical">geochemical</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Astrophysical" title="Astrophysical">astrophysical</a> criteria must be met before an astronomical body can support life.

    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p>The idea that planets beyond Earth might host life is an ancient one, though historically it was framed by <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> as much as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Physical_science" title="Physical science">physical science</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-8">[a]</a> The late 20th century saw two breakthroughs in the field. The observation and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Robotic_spacecraft" title="Robotic spacecraft">robotic spacecraft</a> <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Space_exploration" title="Space exploration">exploration</a> of other planets and moons within the Solar System has provided critical information on defining habitability criteria and allowed for substantial geophysical comparisons between the Earth and other bodies. The discovery of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Exoplanet" title="Exoplanet">exoplanets</a>, beginning in the early 1990s<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-9">[8]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-10">[9]</a> and accelerating thereafter, has provided further information for the study of possible extraterrestrial life. These findings confirm that the Sun is not unique among <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Star" title="Star">stars</a> in hosting planets and expands the habitability research horizon beyond the Solar System.</p>
    <p>While Earth is the only place in the Universe known to harbor life,<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-NASA-1990-11">[10]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Astrobiology-2008-12">[11]</a> estimates of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Habitable_zone" title="Habitable zone">habitable zones</a> around other stars,<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-13">[12]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-NYT-20131118-14">[13]</a> along with the discovery of thousands of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Exoplanet" title="Exoplanet">exoplanets</a> and new insights into the extreme habitats on Earth where organisms known as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Extremophile" title="Extremophile">extremophiles</a> live, suggest that there may be many more habitable places in the Universe than considered possible until very recently.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-NYT-20150106-DB-15">[14]</a> On 4 November 2013, astronomers reported, based on <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Kepler_space_telescope" title="Kepler space telescope"><em>Kepler</em> space mission</a> data, that there could be as many as 40 billion <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Terrestrial_planet" title="Terrestrial planet">Earth-sized</a> <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Extrasolar_planets" title="Extrasolar planets">planets</a> orbiting in the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Habitable_zone" title="Habitable zone">habitable zones</a> of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Solar_analog" title="Solar analog">Sun-like stars</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Red_dwarf" title="Red dwarf">red dwarfs</a> within the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-NYT-20131104-16">[15]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-PNAS-20131031-17">[16]</a> 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-LATimes-20131104-18">[17]</a> The nearest such planet may be 12 <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Light-year" title="Light-year">light-years</a> away, according to the scientists.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-NYT-20131104-16">[15]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-PNAS-20131031-17">[16]</a> As of June 2021, a total of 59 potentially habitable exoplanets have been found.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-phl.upr.edu-19">[18]</a></p>
    <h2 id="stellar">Stellar</h2>
    <p>An understanding of planetary habitability begins with the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Stellar_influences_on_an_origin_of_life_setting" title="Stellar influences on an origin of life setting">host star</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Review_2009-20">[19]</a> The classical habitable zone (HZ) is defined for surface conditions only; but a metabolism that does not depend on the stellar light can still exist outside the HZ, thriving in the interior of the planet where liquid water is available.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Review_2009-20">[19]</a></p>
    <p>Under the auspices of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence" title="Search for extraterrestrial intelligence">SETI</a>&#39;s <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Project_Phoenix_(SETI)" title="Project Phoenix (SETI)">Project Phoenix</a>, scientists <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Margaret_Turnbull" title="Margaret Turnbull">Margaret Turnbull</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Jill_Tarter" title="Jill Tarter">Jill Tarter</a> developed the &quot;<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/HabCat" title="HabCat">HabCat</a>&quot; (or Catalogue of Habitable Stellar Systems) in 2002. The catalogue was formed by winnowing the nearly 120,000 stars of the larger <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Hipparcos_Catalogue" title="Hipparcos Catalogue">Hipparcos Catalogue</a> into a core group of 17,000 potentially habitable stars, and the selection criteria that were used provide a good starting point for understanding which astrophysical factors are necessary for habitable planets.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-ajs.145-21">[20]</a> According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may be more favorable to the formation and development of habitable planets than smaller galaxies, like the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-SP-20150821-22">[21]</a></p>
    <p>However, what makes a planet habitable is a much more complex question than having a planet located at the right distance from its host star so that water can be liquid on its surface: various <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Geophysics" title="Geophysics">geophysical</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Geodynamics" title="Geodynamics">geodynamical</a> aspects, the radiation, and the host star&#39;s <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Plasma_(physics)" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> environment can influence the evolution of planets and life, if it originated.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Review_2009-20">[19]</a> Liquid water is a necessary<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-23">[22]</a> but not sufficient condition for life as we know it, as habitability is a function of a multitude of environmental parameters.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-NASA_strategy_2015-2">[2]</a></p>
    <h3 id="spectral-class">Spectral class</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Stellar_classification" title="Stellar classification">spectral class</a> of a star indicates its <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Photosphere" title="Photosphere">photospheric temperature</a>, which (for <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Main_sequence" title="Main sequence">main-sequence stars</a>) correlates to overall mass. The appropriate spectral range for habitable stars is considered to be &quot;late F&quot; or &quot;G&quot;, to &quot;mid-K&quot;. This corresponds to temperatures of a little more than 7,000 <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Kelvin" title="Kelvin">K</a> down to a little less than 4,000 K (6,700 °C to 3,700 °C); the Sun, a G2 star at 5,777 K, is well within these bounds. This spectral range probably accounts for between 5% and 10% of stars in the local <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Milky_Way_galaxy" title="Milky Way galaxy">Milky Way galaxy</a>. &quot;Middle-class&quot; stars of this sort have a number of characteristics considered important to planetary habitability:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>They live at least a few hundred million years, allowing life a chance to evolve. More <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Luminosity" title="Luminosity">luminous</a> main-sequence stars of the &quot;O&quot; classes and many members of the &quot;B&quot; classes usually live less than 500 million years and in exceptional cases less than 10 million.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-24">[23]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-25">[b]</a></li>
    <li>They emit enough high-frequency <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Ultraviolet_radiation" title="Ultraviolet radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a> to trigger important atmospheric dynamics such as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Ozone" title="Ozone">ozone</a> formation, but not so much that <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Ionisation" title="Ionisation">ionisation</a> destroys incipient life.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-26">[24]</a></li>
    <li>They emit sufficient radiation at wavelengths conducive to photosynthesis.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-27">[25]</a></li>
    <li>Liquid water may exist on the surface of planets orbiting them at a distance that does not induce <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Tidal_locking" title="Tidal locking">tidal locking</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/K-type_main-sequence_star" title="K-type main-sequence star">K-type stars</a> may be able to support life far longer than the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-28">[26]</a></p>
    <p>Whether fainter late K and M class <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Red_dwarf" title="Red dwarf">red dwarf</a> stars are also suitable hosts for habitable planets is perhaps the most important open question in the entire field of planetary habitability given their prevalence (<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Habitability_of_red_dwarf_systems" title="Habitability of red dwarf systems">habitability of red dwarf systems</a>). <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Gliese_581_c" title="Gliese 581 c">Gliese 581 c</a>, a &quot;<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Super-Earth" title="Super-Earth">super-Earth</a>&quot;, has been found orbiting in the &quot;<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Habitable_zone" title="Habitable zone">habitable zone</a>&quot; (HZ) of a <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Red_dwarf" title="Red dwarf">red dwarf</a> and may possess liquid water. However it is also possible that a greenhouse effect may render it too hot to support life, while its neighbor, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Gliese_581_d" title="Gliese 581 d">Gliese 581 d</a>, may be a more likely candidate for habitability.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-29">[27]</a> In September 2010, the discovery was announced of another planet, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Gliese_581_g" title="Gliese 581 g">Gliese 581 g</a>, in an orbit between these two planets. However, reviews of the discovery have placed the existence of this planet in doubt, and it is listed as &quot;unconfirmed&quot;. In September 2012, the discovery of two planets orbiting <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Gliese_163" title="Gliese 163">Gliese 163</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Simbad-20120920-30">[28]</a> was announced.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-PHL-20120829-31">[29]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Space-20120920-32">[30]</a> One of the planets, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Gliese_163_c" title="Gliese 163 c">Gliese 163 c</a>, about 6.9 times the mass of Earth and somewhat hotter, was considered to be within the habitable zone.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-PHL-20120829-31">[29]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Space-20120920-32">[30]</a></p>
    <p>A recent study suggests that cooler stars that emit more light in the infrared and near infrared may actually host warmer planets with less ice and incidence of snowball states. These wavelengths are absorbed by their planets&#39; ice and greenhouse gases and remain warmer.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-red.1112902301-33">[31]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-34">[32]</a></p>
    <p>A 2020 study found that about half of Sun-like stars could host rocky, potentially habitable planets. Specifically, they estimated with that, on average, the nearest habitable zone planet around G and K-type stars is about 6 parsecs away, and there are about 4 rocky planets around G and K-type stars within 10 parsecs (32.6 light years) of the Sun.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-35">[33]</a></p>
    <h3 id="stable-habitable-zone">Stable habitable zone</h3>
    <p>Main article: <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Habitable_zone" title="Habitable zone">Habitable zone</a></p>
    <p>The habitable zone (HZ) is a <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Spherical_shell" title="Spherical shell">shell</a>-shaped region of space surrounding a star in which a planet could maintain liquid water on its surface.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Review_2009-20">[19]</a> The concept was first proposed by astrophysicist <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Su-Shu_Huang" title="Su-Shu Huang">Su-Shu Huang</a> in 1959, based on climatic constraints imposed by the host star.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Review_2009-20">[19]</a> After an energy source, liquid water is widely considered the most important ingredient for life, considering how integral it is to all life systems on Earth. However, if life is discovered in the absence of water, the definition of an HZ may have to be greatly expanded.</p>
    <p>The inner edge of the HZ is the distance where <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Runaway_greenhouse_effect" title="Runaway greenhouse effect">runaway greenhouse effect</a> vaporize the whole water reservoir and, as a second effect, induce the photodissociation of water vapor and the loss of hydrogen to space. The outer edge of the HZ is the distance from the star where a maximum greenhouse effect fails to keep the surface of the planet above the freezing point, and by CO<br>2(carbon dioxide) condensation.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Review_2009-20">[19]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Seager_2013-3">[3]</a></p>
    <p>A &quot;stable&quot; HZ implies two factors. First, the range of an HZ should not vary greatly over time. All stars increase in luminosity as they age, and a given HZ thus migrates outwards, but if this happens too quickly (for example, with a super-massive star) planets may only have a brief window inside the HZ and a correspondingly smaller chance of developing life. Calculating an HZ range and its long-term movement is never straightforward, as negative <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Feedback" title="Feedback">feedback loops</a> such as the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/CNO_cycle" title="CNO cycle">CNO cycle</a> will tend to offset the increases in luminosity. Assumptions made about atmospheric conditions and geology thus have as great an impact on a putative HZ range as does stellar evolution: the proposed parameters of the Sun&#39;s HZ, for example, have fluctuated greatly.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-36">[34]</a></p>
    <p>Second, no large-mass body such as a <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> should be present in or relatively close to the HZ, thus disrupting the formation of Earth-size bodies. The matter in the asteroid belt, for example, appears to have been unable to accrete into a planet due to orbital resonances with Jupiter; if the giant had appeared in the region that is now between the orbits of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Venus" title="Venus">Venus</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>, Earth would almost certainly not have developed in its present form. However a gas giant inside the HZ might have <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Habitable_moon" title="Habitable moon">habitable moons</a> under the right conditions.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-37">[35]</a></p>
    <h3 id="low-stellar-variation">Low stellar variation</h3>
    <p>Changes in <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Luminosity" title="Luminosity">luminosity</a> are common to all stars, but the severity of such fluctuations covers a broad range. Most stars are relatively stable, but a significant minority of variable stars often undergo sudden and intense increases in luminosity and consequently in the amount of energy radiated toward bodies in orbit. These stars are considered poor candidates for hosting life-bearing planets, as their unpredictability and energy output changes would negatively impact <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Organism" title="Organism">organisms</a>: living things adapted to a specific temperature range could not survive too great a temperature variation. Further, upswings in luminosity are generally accompanied by massive doses of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma ray</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/X-ray" title="X-ray">X-ray</a> radiation which might prove lethal. <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Celestial_body_atmosphere" title="Celestial body atmosphere">Atmospheres</a> do mitigate such effects, but their atmosphere might not be retained by planets orbiting variables, because the high-frequency energy buffeting these planets would continually strip them of their protective covering.</p>
    <p>The Sun, in this respect as in many others, is relatively benign: the variation between its maximum and minimum energy output is roughly 0.1% over its 11-year <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Solar_cycle" title="Solar cycle">solar cycle</a>. There is strong (though not undisputed) <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Solar_variation" title="Solar variation">evidence</a> that even minor changes in the Sun&#39;s luminosity have had significant effects on the Earth&#39;s climate well within the historical era: the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Little_Ice_Age" title="Little Ice Age">Little Ice Age</a> of the mid-second millennium, for instance, may have been caused by a relatively long-term decline in the Sun&#39;s luminosity.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-38">[36]</a> Thus, a star does not have to be a true variable for differences in luminosity to affect habitability. Of known <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Solar_analog" title="Solar analog">solar analogs</a>, one that closely resembles the Sun is considered to be <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/18_Scorpii" title="18 Scorpii">18 Scorpii</a>; unfortunately for the prospects of life existing in its proximity, the only significant difference between the two bodies is the amplitude of the solar cycle, which appears to be much greater for 18 Scorpii.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-39">[37]</a></p>
    <h3 id="high-metallicity">High metallicity</h3>

Any planets that did form around a metal-poor star would probably be low in mass, and thus unfavorable for life. <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Spectroscopy" title="Spectroscopy">Spectroscopic</a> studies of systems where <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Exoplanet" title="Exoplanet">exoplanets</a> have been found to date confirm the relationship between high metal content and planet formation: &quot;Stars with planets, or at least with planets similar to the ones we are finding today, are clearly more metal rich than stars without planetary companions.&quot;<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-40">[38]</a> This relationship between high metallicity and planet formation also means that habitable systems are more likely to be found around stars of younger generations, since stars that formed early in the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Universe" title="Universe">universe</a>&#39;s history have low metal content.</p>

    <p>In analyzing which environments are likely to support life, a distinction is usually made between simple, unicellular organisms such as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Archaea" title="Archaea">archaea</a> and complex metazoans (animals). Unicellularity necessarily precedes multicellularity in any hypothetical tree of life, and where single-celled organisms do emerge there is no assurance that greater complexity will then develop.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-50">[d]</a> The planetary characteristics listed below are considered crucial for life generally, but in every case multicellular organisms are more picky than unicellular life.</p>
    <p>In August 2021, a new class of habitable planets, named <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Ocean_planet" title="Ocean planet">ocean planets</a>, which involves &quot;hot, ocean-covered planets with hydrogen-rich atmospheres&quot;, has been reported.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-%3C%22PHY-20210825%22-51">[47]</a> <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Hycean_planet" title="Hycean planet">Hycean planets</a> may soon be studied for <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Biosignature" title="Biosignature">biosignatures</a> by <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Telescope" title="Telescope">terrestrial telescopes</a> as well as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Space_telescope" title="Space telescope">space telescopes</a>, such as the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/James_Webb_Space_Telescope" title="James Webb Space Telescope">James Webb Space Telescope</a> (JWST), which was launched on 25 December 2021.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-BBC-20210827-52">[48]</a></p>
    <h3 id="mass-and-size">Mass and size</h3>
    <p><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>, with its <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Rarefaction" title="Rarefaction">rarefied</a> atmosphere, is colder than the Earth would be if it were at a similar distance from the Sun.</p>
    <p>Low-mass planets are poor candidates for life for two reasons. First, their lesser <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Gravity" title="Gravity">gravity</a> makes <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Celestial_body_atmosphere" title="Celestial body atmosphere">atmosphere</a> retention difficult. Constituent <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</a> are more likely to reach <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Escape_velocity" title="Escape velocity">escape velocity</a> and be lost to space when buffeted by <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Solar_wind" title="Solar wind">solar wind</a> or stirred by collision. Planets without a thick atmosphere lack the matter necessary for primal <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Biochemistry" title="Biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, have little insulation and poor <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Heat_transfer" title="Heat transfer">heat transfer</a> across their surfaces (for example, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>, with its thin atmosphere, is colder than the Earth would be if it were at a similar distance from the Sun), and provide less protection against <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Meteoroid" title="Meteoroid">meteoroids</a> and high-frequency <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a>. Further, where an atmosphere is less dense than 0.006 Earth atmospheres, water cannot exist in liquid form as the required <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">atmospheric pressure</a>, 4.56 <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Torr" title="Torr">mm Hg</a> (608 Pa) (0.18 <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Inch_of_mercury" title="Inch of mercury">inch Hg</a>), does not occur. In addition, a lessened pressure reduces the range of temperatures at which water is liquid.</p>
    <p>Secondly, smaller planets have smaller <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Diameter" title="Diameter">diameters</a> and thus higher surface-to-volume ratios than their larger cousins. Such bodies tend to lose the energy left over from their formation quickly and end up <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Geology" title="Geology">geologically</a> dead, lacking the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Volcano" title="Volcano">volcanoes</a>, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Plate_tectonics" title="Plate tectonics">tectonic activity</a> which supply the surface with life-sustaining material and the atmosphere with temperature moderators like <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. Plate tectonics appear particularly crucial, at least on Earth: not only does the process recycle important chemicals and minerals, it also fosters <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Bio-diversity" title="Bio-diversity">bio-diversity</a> through continent creation and increased environmental complexity and helps create the convective cells necessary to generate <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Earth%27s_magnetic_field" title="Earth&#39;s magnetic field">Earth&#39;s magnetic field</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-53">[49]</a></p>
    <p>&quot;Low mass&quot; is partly a relative label: the Earth is low mass when compared to the Solar System&#39;s <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giants</a>, but it is the largest, by diameter and mass, and the densest of all terrestrial bodies.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-54">[e]</a> It is large enough to retain an atmosphere through gravity alone and large enough that its molten core remains a heat engine, driving the diverse geology of the surface (the decay of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Radioactive" title="Radioactive">radioactive</a> elements within a planet&#39;s core is the other significant component of planetary heating). Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-55">[50]</a> Thus it would be fair to infer that the lower mass limit for habitability lies somewhere between that of Mars and that of Earth or Venus: 0.3 Earth masses has been offered as a rough dividing line for habitable planets.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-56">[51]</a> However, a 2008 study by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics suggests that the dividing line may be higher. Earth may in fact lie on the lower boundary of habitability: if it were any smaller, plate tectonics would be impossible. Venus, which has 85% of Earth&#39;s mass, shows no signs of tectonic activity. Conversely, &quot;<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Super-Earth" title="Super-Earth">super-Earths</a>&quot;, terrestrial planets with higher masses than Earth, would have higher levels of plate tectonics and thus be firmly placed in the habitable range.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-57">[52]</a></p>
    <p>Exceptional circumstances do offer exceptional cases: <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>&#39;s moon <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Io_(moon)" title="Io (moon)">Io</a> (which is smaller than any of the terrestrial planets) is volcanically dynamic because of the gravitational stresses induced by its orbit, and its neighbor <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Europa_(moon)" title="Europa (moon)">Europa</a> may have a liquid ocean or icy slush underneath a frozen shell also due to power generated from orbiting a gas giant.</p>
    <p><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Saturn" title="Saturn">Saturn</a>&#39;s <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Titan_(moon)" title="Titan (moon)">Titan</a>, meanwhile, has an outside chance of harbouring life, as it has retained a thick atmosphere and has liquid <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a> seas on its surface. Organic-chemical reactions that only require minimum energy are possible in these seas, but whether any living system can be based on such minimal reactions is unclear, and would seem unlikely.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-58">[53]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-59">[54]</a> These satellites are exceptions, but they prove that mass, as a criterion for habitability, cannot necessarily be considered definitive at this stage of our understanding.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-60">[55]</a></p>
    <p>A larger planet is likely to have a more massive atmosphere. A combination of higher escape velocity to retain lighter atoms, and extensive outgassing from enhanced plate tectonics may greatly increase the atmospheric pressure and temperature at the surface compared to Earth. The enhanced greenhouse effect of such a heavy atmosphere would tend to suggest that the habitable zone should be further out from the central star for such massive planets.</p>
    <p>Finally, a larger planet is likely to have a large iron core. This allows for a <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Magnetic_field" title="Magnetic field">magnetic field</a> to <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Magnetosphere" title="Magnetosphere">protect</a> the planet from <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Stellar_wind" title="Stellar wind">stellar wind</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Cosmic_radiation" title="Cosmic radiation">cosmic radiation</a>, which otherwise would tend to strip away planetary atmosphere and to bombard living things with ionized particles. Mass is not the only criterion for producing a magnetic field—as the planet must also rotate fast enough to produce a <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Dynamo_Theory" title="Dynamo Theory">dynamo effect</a> within its core<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-61">[56]</a>—but it is a significant component of the process.</p>
    <p>The mass of a potentially habitable exoplanet is between 0.1 and 5.0 Earth masses.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-phl.upr.edu-19">[18]</a> However it is possible for a habitable world to have a mass as low as 0.0268 Earth Masses.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-62">[57]</a> The radius of a potentially habitable exoplanet would range between 0.5 and 1.5 Earth radii.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-phl.upr.edu-19">[18]</a></p>
    <h3 id="orbit-and-rotation">Orbit and rotation</h3>
    <p>As with other criteria, stability is the critical consideration in evaluating the effect of orbital and rotational characteristics on planetary habitability. <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Orbital_eccentricity" title="Orbital eccentricity">Orbital eccentricity</a> is the difference between a planet&#39;s farthest and closest approach to its parent star divided by the sum of said distances. It is a ratio describing the shape of the elliptical orbit. The greater the eccentricity the greater the temperature fluctuation on a planet&#39;s surface. Although they are adaptive, living organisms can stand only so much variation, particularly if the fluctuations overlap both the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Freezing_point" title="Freezing point">freezing point</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Boiling_point" title="Boiling point">boiling point</a> of the planet&#39;s main biotic solvent (e.g., water on Earth). If, for example, Earth&#39;s oceans were alternately boiling and freezing solid, it is difficult to imagine life as we know it having evolved. The more complex the organism, the greater the temperature sensitivity.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-63">[58]</a> The Earth&#39;s orbit is almost perfectly circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.02; other planets in the Solar System (with the exception of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Mercury_(planet)" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>) have eccentricities that are similarly benign.</p>
    <p>Habitability is also influenced by the architecture of the planetary system around a star. The evolution and stability of these systems are determined by gravitational dynamics, which drive the orbital evolution of terrestrial planets. Data collected on the orbital eccentricities of extrasolar planets has surprised most researchers: 90% have an orbital eccentricity greater than that found within the Solar System, and the average is fully 0.25.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-64">[59]</a> This means that the vast majority of planets have highly eccentric orbits and of these, even if their average distance from their star is deemed to be within the HZ, they nonetheless would be spending only a small portion of their time within the zone.</p>
    <p>A planet&#39;s movement around its <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Rotation" title="Rotation">rotational axis</a> must also meet certain criteria if life is to have the opportunity to evolve. A first assumption is that the planet should have moderate <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Season" title="Season">seasons</a>. If there is little or no <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Axial_tilt" title="Axial tilt">axial tilt</a> (or obliquity) relative to the perpendicular of the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Ecliptic" title="Ecliptic">ecliptic</a>, seasons will not occur and a main stimulant to biospheric dynamism will disappear. The planet would also be colder than it would be with a significant tilt: when the greatest intensity of radiation is always within a few degrees of the equator, warm weather cannot move poleward and a planet&#39;s climate becomes dominated by colder polar weather systems.</p>
    <p>If a planet is radically tilted, seasons will be extreme and make it more difficult for a <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Biosphere" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a> to achieve <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Homeostasis" title="Homeostasis">homeostasis</a>. The axial tilt of the Earth is higher now (in the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Quaternary" title="Quaternary">Quaternary</a>) than it has been in the past, coinciding with reduced polar <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Glacier" title="Glacier">ice</a>, warmer temperatures and <em>less</em> seasonal variation. Scientists do not know whether this trend will continue indefinitely with further increases in axial tilt (see <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Snowball_Earth" title="Snowball Earth">Snowball Earth</a>).</p>
    <p>The exact effects of these changes can only be computer modelled at present, and studies have shown that even extreme tilts of up to 85 degrees do not absolutely preclude life &quot;provided it does not occupy continental surfaces plagued seasonally by the highest temperature.&quot;<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-65">[60]</a> Not only the mean axial tilt, but also its variation over time must be considered. The Earth&#39;s tilt varies between 21.5 and 24.5 degrees over 41,000 years. A more drastic variation, or a much shorter periodicity, would induce climatic effects such as variations in seasonal severity.</p>
    <p>Other orbital considerations include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The planet should rotate relatively quickly so that the day-night cycle is not overlong. If a day takes years, the temperature differential between the day and night side will be pronounced, and problems similar to those noted with extreme orbital eccentricity will come to the fore.</li>
    <li>The planet also should rotate quickly enough so that a magnetic dynamo may be started in its iron core to produce a magnetic field.</li>
    <li>Change in the direction of the axis rotation (<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Precession" title="Precession">precession</a>) should not be pronounced. In itself, precession need not affect habitability as it changes the direction of the tilt, not its degree. However, precession tends to accentuate variations caused by other orbital deviations; see <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Milankovitch_cycles" title="Milankovitch cycles">Milankovitch cycles</a>. Precession on Earth occurs over a 26,000-year cycle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Earth&#39;s <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a> appears to play a <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Earth#Moon" title="Earth">crucial role</a> in moderating the Earth&#39;s climate by stabilising the axial tilt. It has been suggested that a chaotic tilt may be a &quot;deal-breaker&quot; in terms of habitability—i.e. a satellite the size of the Moon is not only helpful but required to produce stability.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-66">[61]</a> This position remains controversial.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-67">[f]</a></p>
    <p>In the case of the Earth, the sole Moon is sufficiently massive and orbits so as to significantly contribute to <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Ocean_tides" title="Ocean tides">ocean tides</a>, which in turn aids the dynamic churning of Earth&#39;s large liquid water oceans.

Carbon has an unparalleled ability to bond with itself and to form a massive array of intricate and varied structures, making it an ideal material for the complex mechanisms that form living <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Cell_(biology)" title="Cell (biology)">cells</a>.

    <p>Relative abundance in space does not always mirror differentiated abundance within planets; of the four life elements, for instance, only <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> is present in any abundance in the Earth&#39;s <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Crust_(geology)" title="Crust (geology)">crust</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-74">[68]</a> This can be partly explained by the fact that many of these elements, such as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Nitrogen" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, along with their simplest and most common compounds, such as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Carbon_dioxide" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Carbon_monoxide" title="Carbon monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Ammonia" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>, and water, are gaseous at warm temperatures. In the hot region close to the Sun, these volatile compounds could not have played a significant role in the planets&#39; geological formation. Instead, they were trapped as gases underneath the newly formed crusts, which were largely made of rocky, involatile compounds such as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Silica" title="Silica">silica</a> (a compound of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Silicon" title="Silicon">silicon</a> and oxygen, accounting for oxygen&#39;s relative abundance). <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Outgassing" title="Outgassing">Outgassing</a> of volatile compounds through the first volcanoes would have contributed to the formation of the planets&#39; <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Celestial_body_atmosphere" title="Celestial body atmosphere">atmospheres</a>. The <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment" title="Miller–Urey experiment">Miller–Urey experiment</a> showed that, with the application of energy, simple inorganic compounds exposed to a primordial atmosphere can react to synthesize <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-75">[69]</a></p>
    <p>Even so, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Volcanism" title="Volcanism">volcanic</a> outgassing could not have accounted for the amount of water in Earth&#39;s oceans.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-76">[70]</a> The vast majority of the water—and arguably carbon—necessary for life must have come from the outer Solar System, away from the Sun&#39;s heat, where it could remain solid. <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Comet" title="Comet">Comets</a> impacting with the Earth in the Solar System&#39;s early years would have deposited vast amounts of water, along with the other volatile compounds life requires, onto the early Earth, providing a kick-start to the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Origin_of_life" title="Origin of life">origin of life</a>.</p>
    <p>Thus, while there is reason to suspect that the four &quot;life elements&quot; ought to be readily available elsewhere, a habitable system probably also requires a supply of long-term orbiting bodies to seed inner planets. Without comets there is a possibility that life as we know it would not exist on Earth.</p>
    <h3 id="microenvironments-and-extremophiles">Microenvironments and extremophiles</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Atacama_Desert" title="Atacama Desert">Atacama Desert</a> in <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/South_America" title="South America">South America</a> provides an analog to <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a> and an ideal environment to study the boundary between sterility and habitability.</p>
    <p>One important qualification to habitability criteria is that only a tiny portion of a planet is required to support life, a so-called Goldilocks Edge or Great Prebiotic Spot. Astrobiologists often concern themselves with &quot;micro-environments&quot;, noting that &quot;we lack a fundamental understanding of how evolutionary forces, such as <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Genetic_mutation" title="Genetic mutation">mutation</a>, <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">selection</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Genetic_drift" title="Genetic drift">genetic drift</a>, operate in micro-organisms that act on and respond to changing micro-environments.&quot;<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-77">[71]</a> <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Extremophile" title="Extremophile">Extremophiles</a> are Earth organisms that live in niche environments under severe conditions generally considered <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inimical#Adjective" title="wikt:inimical">inimical</a> to life. Usually (although not always) unicellular, extremophiles include acutely <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Alkaliphile" title="Alkaliphile">alkaliphilic</a> and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Acidophile_(organisms)" title="Acidophile (organisms)">acidophilic</a> organisms and others that can survive water temperatures above 100 °C in <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Hydrothermal_vents" title="Hydrothermal vents">hydrothermal vents</a>.</p>
    <p>The discovery of life in extreme conditions has complicated definitions of habitability, but also generated much excitement amongst researchers in greatly broadening the known range of conditions under which life can persist. For example, a planet that might otherwise be unable to support an atmosphere given the solar conditions in its vicinity, might be able to do so within a deep shadowed rift or volcanic cave.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-78">[72]</a> Similarly, craterous terrain might offer a refuge for primitive life. The <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Lawn_Hill_crater" title="Lawn Hill crater">Lawn Hill crater</a> has been studied as an astrobiological analog, with researchers suggesting rapid sediment infill created a protected microenvironment for microbial organisms; similar conditions may have occurred over the geological history of <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-79">[73]</a></p>
    <p>Earth environments that <em>cannot</em> support life are still instructive to astrobiologists in defining the limits of what organisms can endure. The heart of the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Atacama_Desert" title="Atacama Desert">Atacama Desert</a>, generally considered the driest place on Earth, appears unable to support life, and it has been subject to study by NASA and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/European_Space_Agency" title="European Space Agency">ESA</a> for that reason: it provides a Mars analog and the moisture gradients along its edges are ideal for studying the boundary between sterility and habitability.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-80">[74]</a> The Atacama was the subject of study in 2003 that partly replicated experiments from the <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Viking_(spacecraft)" title="Viking (spacecraft)">Viking</a> landings on Mars in the 1970s; no <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> could be recovered from two soil samples, and incubation experiments were also negative for <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Biosignature" title="Biosignature">biosignatures</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-81">[75]</a></p>
    <h3 id="ecological-factors">Ecological factors</h3>
    <p>cological approaches for predicting the potential habitability use 19 or 20 environmental factors, with emphasis on water availability, temperature, presence of nutrients, an energy source, and protection from solar ultraviolet and <a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Cosmic_ray" title="Cosmic ray">galactic cosmic radiation</a>.<a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-D.C.Golden-82">[76]</a><a href="https://wiki.jwint.net/Planetary_habitability#cite_note-Beaty-83">[77]</a></p>
